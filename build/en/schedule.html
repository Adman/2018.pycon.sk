            <h3>Docs or it didn&#39;t happen<span class="label other">other</span><br /><small>Mikey Ariel (CZ)</small></h3>
            <p>If you ever skimmed through a README, tried to follow a quickstart tutorial, attempted to decipher an error message, or typed '--help' in your terminal, congratulations -- you have encountered documentation!</p><p>Long gone are the days of massive books with never-ending stories about your software. Today's users are smarter and less patient, which means that we no longer need to document *all the things*, as long as what we do document is clear, concise, helpful, and accessible. And that's where the real work starts.</p><p>Documentation requires some attitude adjustment, since prose doesn't neatly compile into binaries as code does. But Don't Panic(tm)! No matter what your role is in the community, you can apply a few key principles from the technical writing world to make your project more docs-friendly, and therefore more user- and contributor-friendly.</p><p>This high-level (and all-level) talk aims to introduce or re-acquaint you with topics such as content strategy, docs-as-code, optimized DevOps for docs, and contribution workflows. Open-source projects of all shapes, ages, sizes are welcome!</p>

            <h3>The Concierge Paradigm<span class="label devops">devops</span><br /><small>Gareth Brown (UK)</small></h3>
            <p>The Concierge Paradigm idea was born over time but initially came from challenges we had by working out how to operate scalable and enterprise-grade application containers. This meant monitoring, logging, deploying, scaling, load-balancing and service discovery. We needed to do this both on-premise and in AWS. We were running some docker tasks in ECS and a Kubernetes and CoreOS cluster on-premise but we hadn't chosen these by researching different options, they were pretty much the first options we came across. We'd felt the difficulties of our decision, so started to look out to the wider community at other options.</p><p>This is the story of what we discovered. How we made our application monitoring more efficient and accurate; how we radically simplified the infrastructure needed for running containers and how we utilised Zabbix as an container scheduler.</p>

            <h3>LOCKED SHIELDS - ako má vypadať dobre urobené kybertestovanie<span class="label security">security</span><br /><small>Peter Garaj (SK)</small></h3>
            <p>Cvičenie LOCKED SHIELDS je organizované Centrom výnimočnosti pre oblasť kybernetickej obrany (CCD CoE). Jedným s jeho počinov je cvičenie LOCKED SHIELDS, ktoré je svojou veľkosťou, rozsiahlosťou a zameraním jedným s najunikátnejších kybercvičení na svete.</p><p>Ako človek, ktorý sa tohto každoročného cvičenia sporadicky zúčastňuje by som rád povedal niečo o tom, ako to vypadá zvnútra a ako sa slovenská vojenská kybernetická elita cvičí na zásah proti kybernarušiteľom.</p>

            <h3>Introduction to Machine Learning with Python<span class="label ai">ai</span><br /><small>Katharine Jarmul (DE)</small></h3>
            <p>In this half-day workshop, we'll take a walk through a Kaggle competition on house prices to explore our dataset. Then, we'll build a model to submit our predictions to Kaggle. Finally, we'll introspect what our model has learned. By the end of the course, you should have an idea of how to get competing on Kaggle or building your own models with Python and scikit-learn.</p><p>Students are expected to arrive ready to learn and with all packages properly installed. There will also be some theoretical discussions on machine learning practices, and some group work.</p><p>GitHub Repo: https://github.com/kjam/intro-to-ml</p>

            <h3>Programming Python as performance: live coding with FoxDot<span class="label other">other</span><br /><small>Ryan Kirkbride (UK)</small></h3>
            <p>In this talk I will introduce the topic of live coding; the interactive programming experience for generating audio and visuals but this talk will mainly focus on audio. Live coders use programming languages to describe rules for generating music but then re-write these rules while the program is running. By continually writing and re-writing these rules live coders creating a shifting musical experience that is always in flux. All of this happens live in front of audience with the code projected for all to see. I will go on to discuss the multiple tools that are available for live coding and showcase the FoxDot environment, which allows you to live code music using Python. I will talk about the motivation for developing FoxDot and describe some of its key features as well as how you can set it up yourself at home. The talk will be concluded with a short demonstration that will be part explanation and part performance.

            <h3>Effectively running python applications in Kubernetes/OpenShift<span class="label devops">devops</span><br /><small>Maciej Szulik (PL)</small></h3>
            <p>Google, Red Hat, Intel, Huawei, Mirantis, Deis and many, many others are investinga lot of time and effort into improving Kubernetes.  I bet, you have encounteredthat name at least once in the past twelve months, either on Hacker News, Reddit,or somewhere else.  Do you want to learn more about the best container orchestrationin the universe, but were afraid of the setup complexity?  Do you want to see howeasy it is to run any application using containers?  Do you want to experiencethe joy of scaling application with a single click?  This, and a lot more will bediscussed in details.</p><p>In this tutorial, every attendee will be provided with an environment, and step bystep instructions necessary to setup the environment, build and deploy a microservicesbased sample application.  Alternatively, a sample application of any choosing canbe used throughout the entire tutorial.  All that will be performed on OpenShift,which is a Red Hat distribution of Kuberenets with some add-ons that will be describedin details at the beginning of the tutorial.  To wet your appetite even more, hereare some of the topics we are going to cover:<ul><li>automatic build and deployment</li><li>git integration</li><li>image registry integration</li><li>scaling application</li><li>containers security</li><li>batch tasks</li></ul>and much more.</p><p>After the session, every person will be able to play around with the accompanyingcode repository that was used in the tutorial, which includes detailed instructionshow to run it on your own from scratch.</p>
